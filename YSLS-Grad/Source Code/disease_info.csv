HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter. Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening","<b> Suggestion : </b> Management and a combination of cultural practices, chemical controls and preventative measures.

Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato and potato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of tomato plants.
The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.
Late blight of potato was responsible for the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.","<b> Suggestion : </b> Management and a combination of cultural practices, chemical controls and preventative measures. Here are some commonly used methods to control and treat : </br></br>
<i><b>Trimming:</b></i>Sanitation is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit. Currently, there are no strains of tomato available that are resistant to late tomato blight, so plants should be inspected at least twice a week. Since late blight symptoms are more likely to occur during wet conditions, more care should be taken during those times. For the home gardener, fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed.  "
32,Leaf : Tomato </br> Disease : Leaf Mold,"Tomato leaf mold is a fungal disease that can develop when there are extended periods of leaf wetness and the relative humidity is high (greater than 85 percent). Due to this moisture requirement, the disease is seen primarily in hoophouses and greenhouses. Tomato leaf mold can develop during early spring temperatures (50.9 degrees Fahrenheit) or those characteristic of summer (90 F). The optimal temperature tomato leaf mold is in the low 70s.

Symptoms of disease include yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. Discrete masses of olive-green spores can be seen on the underside of the affected leaves.","<b> Suggestion : </b> Management and a combination of cultural practices, chemical controls and preventative measures. Here are some commonly used methods to control and treat : </br></br>
<i><b>Trimming:</b></i>When treating tomato plants with fungicide, be sure to cover all areas of the plant that are above the soil, especially the underside of leaves, where the disease often forms. Calcium chloride-based sprays are recommended for treating leaf mold issues. Organic fungicide options are also available. "
33,Leaf : Tomato </br> Disease : Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spot, caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, is a common and damaging disease that affects tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). This disease primarily targets the leaves of tomato plants and can lead to defoliation, reduced fruit yield, and overall plant health decline if not properly managed.
Here's information on Septoria leaf spot in tomatoes and how to manage it:
Symptoms:
Leaf Symptoms: Infected tomato leaves develop small, circular lesions with dark centers and lighter, grayish margins. The lesions often have a characteristic ""bull's-eye"" appearance with a yellow halo around the lesion. As the disease progresses, the lesions can merge and cause premature leaf drop.
","<b> Suggestion :</b> Disease management and treatment involves a combination of cultural practices, resistant varieties and fungicide applications:</br></br>
<i><b>Step 1. Crop Rotation:</b></i> Practice crop rotation to reduce the buildup of disease inoculum in the soil. Avoid planting tomatoes or other related crops in the same location for consecutive seasons.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 2. Sanitation:</b></i> Remove and destroy any infected plant debris, including affected leaves, after harvest. This helps prevent overwintering of the fungus.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 3. Resistant Varieties:</b></i> Choose tomato varieties that are resistant to Septoria leaf spot. Resistant varieties can significantly reduce disease severity.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 4. Spacing and Air Circulation:</b></i> Plant tomatoes with proper spacing to ensure good airflow within the canopy. Proper air circulation reduces humidity and slows disease development.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 5. Pruning:</b></i> Regularly prune lower leaves to increase air circulation and prevent the fungus from splashing onto the plants during rainfall or irrigation.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 6. Mulching:</b></i> Apply mulch around the base of tomato plants to prevent soil-borne spores from splashing onto the lower leaves.</br></br>
By following these management practices, you can effectively control and reduce the impact of Septoria leaf spot on your tomato plants.

34,Leaf : Tomato </br> Disease : Spider Mites | Two-Spotted Spider Mite ,"The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops in New England. Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. As with most pests, catching the problem early will mean easier control.","<b> Suggestion : </b> Management and a combination of cultural practices, chemical controls and preventative measures. Here are some commonly used methods to control and treat : </br></br>
<i><b>Trimming:</b></i>Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.
Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.
Do not over-fertilize.
Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations. "
35,Leaf : Tomato </br> Disease : Target Spot ,"The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards. The first signs are irregular-shaped spots (less than 1 mm) with a yellow margin . Some of the spots enlarge up to 10 mm and show characteristics rings, hence the name of ""target spot"" . Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid , causing the leaves to turn yellow, collapse and die . Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.
The spores are spread by wind-blown rain, and if windy wet weather continues for a few days, spread is fast and plants lose their leaves quickly.","<b> Suggestion : </b> Management and a combination of cultural practices, chemical controls and preventative measures. Here are some commonly used methods to control and treat : </br></br>
<i><b>Trimming:</b></i>Cultural control is important. The following should be done:
Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.
Plant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5).
Check all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.
Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.
Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.
Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.  "
36,Leaf : Tomato </br> Disease : Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a devastating viral disease that affects tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) and other members of the Solanaceae family, such as peppers and eggplants. It is one of the most damaging and economically significant diseases affecting tomato crops, causing severe yield losses and reducing fruit quality. TYLCV is transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, also known as the silverleaf whitefly.
Symptoms of tomato yellow leaf curl virus include:
Yellowing and Curling of Leaves: Infected plants display yellowing and upward curling of the young leaves. The leaf margins may also become curled and inwardly rolled.
Leaf Thickening: The leaves of infected plants may become thickened, leathery, and brittle.
Stunted Growth: Infected plants often exhibit reduced growth and stunting, particularly in younger plants.
Flower and Fruit Abnormalities: Flowers and developing fruit on infected plants may show abnormalities, such as smaller size, deformation, and reduced yields.
Leaf Curling and Cupping: The leaves may curl even more tightly and appear cupped.
Silvering of Leaves: The upper leaf surfaces may develop a silvery sheen due to the distortion and curling of the leaves.
TYLCV is transmitted by the whitefly vector when it feeds on an infected plant and then moves on to a healthy plant, introducing the virus. The virus can also be transmitted through infected plant material and contaminated tools.
","<b> Suggestion :</b> Management and treatment of tomato yellow leaf curl virus include various strategies:</br></br>
<i><b>Step 1. Whitefly Control:</b></i> Management and treatment of tomato yellow leaf curl virus include various strategies:</br></br>
<i><b>Step 2. Resistant Varieties:</b></i> Plant tomato varieties that have been bred for resistance to TYLCV. These varieties are less susceptible to the disease and can help reduce its impact.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 3. Vector Management:</b></i> Use cultural practices like early planting, removing and destroying infected plants, and weed control to disrupt the virus's lifecycle and reduce whitefly populations.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 4. Reflective Mulches:</b></i> Reflective mulches can deter whiteflies from landing on plants, reducing virus transmission.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 5. Regular Monitoring:</b></i> Regularly scout tomato plants for symptoms of TYLCV and whitefly presence. Early detection allows for timely intervention.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 6. Minimize Spread:</b></i> Avoid moving infected plants, as well as whitefly-infested plants, to new areas to prevent the spread of the virus.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 7. Sanitation:</b></i> Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the buildup of virus sources.</br></br>
<i><b>Step 8. Integrated Pest Management (IPM):</b></i> Implement an IPM approach that combines various techniques, including whitefly control, resistant varieties, and monitoring, to effectively manage TYLCV.</br></br>
Given the significant economic impact of TYLCV, it's important to adopt proactive management strategies and consult with local agricultural extension services or experts for region-specific advice on preventing and managing the disease.
